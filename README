So far Halstead Length (ACHECK) and Number of Comments (BCHECK) are working and implemented properly.
Operands so far have only been defined as TokenTypes.NUM_INT, TokenTypes.NUM_DOUBLE and TokenTypes.IDENT. 
Operators so far have only been defined as TokenTypes.PLUS, TokenTypes.MINUS, TokenTypes.DIV, TokenTypes.STAR, TokenTypes.ASSIGN, TokenTypes.MOD.
Future plans include adding more TokenTypes for the checks and fixing issues with other checks, also the checkstyle-metadata.propertes need to be updated.

Structural metrics:
Category A:
- Halstead Length is the sum of the total number of operators and operand [1,2] - implemented
- Halstead Vocabulary is the sum of the number of unique operators and unique - implemented
operands [1,2]
- Halstead Volume is the program length (N) times the log2 of the program vocabulary (n) - implemented
[1,2] : Volume = N log2 n
- Halstead Difficulty is half of the unique operators multiplied by the total number of - TBD
operands, divided by the number of unique operands [1,2]
- Halstead Effort is the difficulty multiplied by the volume. Effort = DV. Effort was - implemented
intended as a suggestion for how long code review might take [1,2]

Category B:
- Number of comments [3] - implemented
- Number of lines of comments [3] - implemented
- Number of looping statements [3] - TBD
- Number of operators [3] - implemented
- Number of operands [3] - implemented
- Number of expressions [3] - implemented

Optional/Extra credits:
- Number of variable declarations [4] - implemented
- External Method references are the number of methods called from an external class [4] - TBD
- Local method references are the number of methods called from the same class [4] - TBD
- Number of casts - TBD
- Maintainability Index measures how maintainable the source code is. - TBD
The maintainability index is calculated as a factored formula consisting of Lines of Code, -TBD
Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead volume [5]:
MI = 171 - 5.2 * log2(V) - 0.23 * G - 16.2 * log2 (LOC) + 50 * sin (sqrt(2.4 * CM)), where:
 V = Halstead Volume
 G = Cyclomatic Complexity
 LOC = count of source Lines Of Code (SLOC) - TBD
 CM = percent of lines of Comment (optional) -TBD
